The Burrito UNMSM Project was a student initiative that successfully achieved
real-time school bus localization for the
[National University of San Marcos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_San_Marcos).

Despite being an unofficial solution, it rapidly expanded in scope and impact,
ultimately serving over 2,000 students daily with real-time bus location data
and service updates.

Operations ceased at the end of December 2024, following the university's
decision to adopt professional (although inferior) geolocation services.

The project was publicly associated with Contigo San Marcos, a local student
political party. However, the true credit belongs to a core group of
dedicated individuals who helped in its development and maintenance:
